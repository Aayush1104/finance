# finance
This project is a replication of the stock market which allows the user to do multiple tasks. Finance is a project that I had programmed during my time in the course cs50x.

To run this code, an API key will be required. Execute the following commands where value is the API key value:
$ export API_KEY=value
$ flask run
This should allow you to open up the link of the finance website. 

This dynamic Python project offers users an immersive experience, allowing them to create personalized accounts through a seamless registration process with secure password authentication. The platform empowers users to explore real-time stock market trends using the IEX API and engage in a virtual stock market simulation with an initial $10,000 USD capital. Built on the Flask framework, this application seamlessly combines user authentication, real-time data retrieval, and transaction history for an engaging exploration of financial markets.
