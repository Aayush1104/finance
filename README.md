# finance
This project is a replication of the stock market which allows the user to do multiple tasks. Finance is a project that I had programmed during my time in the course cs50x.

To run this code, an API key will be required. Execute the following commands where value is the API key value:
$ export API_KEY=value
$ flask run
This should allow you to open up the link of the finance website. 

The functionality of this project includes the ability for a user to register for their own account which is stored in a database. The correct password is required to access
an account on this site. Users are also able to search up the updated stock prices of real companies. Each user is given $10,000 USD to spend on the stock market. Of course,
as this is a replication, the money is not real. Similar to a normal stock market, the user can sell stocks and see the history of their purchases and sales.
